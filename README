# Peer assessment

This script generates a new dataset from the training and test measurement files given. The new dataset only contains the variables that have a name that ends with "-std()" or "-mean()".
The new dataset can be generated simply by executing the following line:
Rscript run_analysis.R

The folder with the dataset is in the same one as the script and the name of the output file is fulldataset_mean_std.txt.


Th steps are as follows:
1) Load the feature information
2) Load the needed features. I was nos satisfied with the read functions provided by the base environment so I implemented one that only selects the indices needed.
3) Merge the train and test datasets.
4) Load the activity labels.
5) Translate the activity indexes to labels.
6) Add the activity labels to the dataset generated on step 3.
7) Save the new dataset.
